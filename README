In this project we were tasked with creating a simple mobile app that functions as a grocery list assisstant when shopping for groceries. 
We had to include the html, css, and javascript in the coding work; and a new system we had to learn and implement was the Firebase system in order to store data in it (database).
We were also tasked with making the app mobile friendly and responsive, then deploy it to Netlify for others to use.

Some of the struggles I faced were overcome with the help of my classmates and some ingenuity (and some redbull to focus). One of the main struggles I faced was trying to append my shopping list and trying to focus on many lines of code to figure out why my code had an error in the console. 

What I found most interesting was the refactoring of code in order to make it more aesthetic and legible and easier to understand. Another thing I found interesting was getting to deploy a coded app to Netlify, or rather the web in general for public access, that was a cool experience. 


The entire process of creating the app was very exciting, I learnt a lot of new skills and knowledge. I genuinely had fun and the experience made me eager to learn more.
